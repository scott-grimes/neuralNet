Implements a simple feedforward neural net in java using stochastic gradient descent
and the quadratic cost function.

This simple network demonstrates the power neural nets have in image recognition.
In just a few minutes the network can be trained to recognize digits from the MNIST
dataset with over 90% accuracy
